# Mucin Project
This is the project I work on between 2025-2027 at University of Leicester. The goal is to further characterise a complex gene locus on the Chromosome 11 which code MUC5AC and MUC5B. These mucins are highly correlated with severe asthma.

# Project Structure
1. Characterise novel regulatory (non-coding) variants within the mucin locus on the Chromosome 11 via colocalization analysis (See Repo Coloc)
2. Identify novel structual variants (SVs) called from short-read and long-read DNA sequencing within the locus (See Repo SVCompare)
3. Impute novel variants into UK Biobank to test their association with moderate-severe asthma
4. Run Deep PheWAS to understand potential pleiotropy
